# Product Requirements Document

## Requirement-001: Define the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)

**Objective:** Establish a standardized process for all development work to ensure quality, security, and clarity.

**Details:**

1.  **Requirement Analysis:**
    - All new requirements must be clarified and assumptions confirmed before work begins.
    - The finalized requirement shall be logged in this document (`prd.txt`).

2.  **High-Level Design:**
    - A `design.txt` file will be created to capture the high-level system design, including architecture and component interactions.
    - Diagrams will be stored in text-based formats (e.g., ASCII, Mermaid).

3.  **Low-Level Design:**
    - A `lowlevel.txt` file will be created for detailed implementation plans, including function/class specifications.

4.  **Implementation:**
    - Code will be written based on the design documents.
    - Guiding principles: Security-first, modularity, and a preference for Python.

5.  **Testing:**
    - A comprehensive test suite (unit, integration, automation) must be developed alongside the code.

## Requirement-004: Snake and Ladder Game - MVP2

**Objective:** Enhance the game with multiplayer, better feedback, and replayability features.

**User Stories:**

*   **Story 1 (Two-Player Mode):** As a player, I want to be able to play against another person on the same device ("hot-seat" mode), so I can experience the game's competitive fun with a friend.
*   **Story 2 (AI Opponent):** As a solo player, I want the option to play against a simple computer-controlled opponent, so I have a challenge even when playing by myself.
*   **Story 3 (Defined Board Layout):** As a player, I want to play on a single, well-designed board with a fixed layout of snakes and ladders, ensuring a balanced and consistent game experience every time.
*   **Story 4 (Piece Selection):** As a player, I want to choose my game piece's color or icon before the game starts, so I can personalize my experience.
*   **Story 5 (Visual Feedback):** As a player, I want to see my piece animate smoothly from one square to the next, and see the dice perform a roll animation, to make the game feel more dynamic and alive.
*   **Story 6 (Audio Feedback):** As a player, I want to hear simple sound effects when I roll the dice, land on a snake, or climb a ladder, to enhance the game's immersiveness.
*   **Story 7 (Celebratory Win):** As a player who has won, I want to see a visually exciting celebration, like a confetti effect, to make my victory feel more rewarding.
*   **Story 8 (Score Keeping):** As a player, I want the game to keep a simple score of how many wins each player (Player 1 vs. Player 2/AI) has, to encourage friendly competition and replay.
*   **Story 9 (Instructions):** As a new user, I want to be able to view a "How to Play" section that explains the rules, especially the "must land exactly on 100" rule, so I can understand how to play correctly.
*   **Story 10 (State Persistence):** As a player, if I accidentally refresh the page mid-game, I want the game to remember my current position, so I don't lose my progress.
*   **Story 11 (Accessibility):** As a user who relies on a keyboard, I want to be able to start the game and roll the dice using only the keyboard (e.g., using the `Enter` or `Space` key), so the game is accessible to me.
