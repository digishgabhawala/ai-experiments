# Product Requirements Document

## Requirement-001: Define the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)

**Objective:** Establish a standardized process for all development work to ensure quality, security, and clarity.

**Details:**

1.  **Requirement Analysis:**
    - All new requirements must be clarified and assumptions confirmed before work begins.
    - The finalized requirement shall be logged in this document (`prd.txt`).

2.  **High-Level Design:**
    - A `design.txt` file will be created to capture the high-level system design, including architecture and component interactions.
    - Diagrams will be stored in text-based formats (e.g., ASCII, Mermaid).

3.  **Low-Level Design:**
    - A `lowlevel.txt` file will be created for detailed implementation plans, including function/class specifications.

4.  **Implementation:**
    - Code will be written based on the design documents.
    - Guiding principles: Security-first, modularity, and a preference for Python.

5.  **Testing:**
    - A comprehensive test suite (unit, integration, automation) must be developed alongside the code.
