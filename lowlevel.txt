# Low-Level Design: Snake and Ladder Game

## 1. `main.py` - Web Server
- **Objective:** Start a simple HTTP server to serve files from the `static` directory.
- **Implementation Details:**
    - No changes from the previous design. The server's role remains the same.

## 2. `static/index.html`
- **Objective:** Provide the HTML structure for all game views.
- **Content:**
    - A main container `div` with an ID like `app`.
    - Inside `#app`, two main `div` elements will exist:
        - A "Welcome Screen" `div` with an ID like `welcome-screen`. It will be visible by default.
            - An `h1` with the text "Snake and Ladder".
            - A `button` with an ID like `play-button` and the text "Play".
        - A "Game Screen" `div` with an ID like `game-screen`. It will be hidden by default using a CSS class (e.g., `hidden`).
            - This will be populated with the game board and controls in later stories.

## 3. `static/style.css`
- **Objective:** Style the different game views and UI elements.
- **Content:**
    - Basic styles for the `body` to center content.
    - Styles for the `#welcome-screen` to format it as a distinct view.
    - A utility class `.hidden` with the property `display: none;` to easily toggle the visibility of views.

## 4. `static/script.js`
- **Objective:** Manage UI transitions and initial game setup.
- **Content:**
    - An event listener for `DOMContentLoaded`.
    - Inside the listener:
        - Get references to the `#welcome-screen`, `#game-screen`, and `#play-button` elements.
        - Add a `click` event listener to the `#play-button`.
        - When the `#play-button` is clicked:
            - Add the `hidden` class to the `#welcome-screen`.
            - Remove the `hidden` class from the `#game-screen`.

## 5. Testing Plan
- **Manual Testing:**
    1. Run `python main.py`.
    2. Open `http://localhost:8000`.
    3. **Verify:** The "Snake and Ladder" title and the "Play" button are visible. The game board is not visible.
    4. Click the "Play" button.
    5. **Verify:** The welcome screen disappears, and the (currently empty) game screen container becomes visible.
- **Automated Testing:**
    - **UI Test (`test_game.py`):**
        - A new test script will be created using Selenium.
        - It will navigate to the page and verify the initial visibility of the welcome screen and the invisibility of the game screen.
        - It will simulate a click on the `#play-button`.
        - It will assert that the welcome screen is now hidden and the game screen is visible.
