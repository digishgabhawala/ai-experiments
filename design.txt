# High-Level Design: Snake and Ladder Game

## 1. Overview

The system is a client-side, single-player web application that renders a playable Snake and Ladder game. The backend is a simple Python static file server that delivers the necessary HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to the client's browser. The game logic and UI are managed entirely by JavaScript in the browser.

## 2. Components

- **Web Server (`main.py`):** A minimal Python HTTP server to serve the application files from the `static/` directory. Its role is purely to deliver the content and does not involve any game logic.
- **Game Client (`static/` directory):**
    - `index.html`: The main HTML document. It contains the structure for different game views (e.g., welcome screen, game board screen).
    - `style.css`: Provides the styling for all UI elements, including the game board, player pieces, and different game states.
    - `script.js`: The core of the application. It contains all the game logic, including managing game state (welcome, playing, win), handling user input (button clicks, dice rolls), and dynamically updating the DOM.

## 3. Architecture & Data Flow

The architecture is a simple static site model. The primary logic resides on the client.

```
+----------+       HTTP Request for       +--------------+
|          |      static assets (HTML,    |              |
|  Client  |      CSS, JS)                |  Web Server  |
| (Browser)| ---------------------------> |  (`main.py`) |
|          |                              |              |
|          | <--------------------------- |              |
+----------+       HTTP Response          +-------+------+
     |                                            |
     | Renders Game, Handles Logic                | Serves files from
     v                                            v
+---------------------------------+         +--------------+
|                                 |         | `static/`    |
|  Client-Side Application        |         |  directory   |
|  (Manages UI and Game State)    |         +--------------+
|                                 |
+---------------------------------+
```

1.  The user starts the server (`python main.py`) and navigates to `http://localhost:8000`.
2.  The server delivers `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js`.
3.  The browser executes `script.js`, which initially renders the **Welcome Screen**.
4.  The user interacts with the UI (e.g., clicks "Play").
5.  JavaScript captures this event and updates the DOM to transition to the **Game Screen**, hiding the Welcome Screen.
6.  All subsequent game logic (dice rolls, movement) is handled on the client-side.

## 4. Security Considerations

- The Python server's working directory is explicitly changed to `static/` before startup. This mitigates directory traversal attacks and ensures that only intended application files are exposed.
